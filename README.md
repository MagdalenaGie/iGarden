## Short descripton of the idea
A Django web-application that recognises flowers based on uploaded image and provides information on taking care of it. Besides, there are some basic knowledge about species.
#### List of features:
 - Information on growing selected flowers
 - User created lists of plants (e.g. "Home", "Wish List")
 - Recognition of flowers using machine learning (possible learning datasets: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/)
