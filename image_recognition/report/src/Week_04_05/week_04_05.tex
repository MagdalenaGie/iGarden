	\section{Introduction}
		\subsection{Autoencoder}
			An autoencoder is a neural network trained to encode and then decode data.
			In this case the autoencoder was meant to handle image data.
			The network consist of two parts, the encoder, responsible - as the name says - for encoding the data, and decoder recovering original image.
			Encoder was built using three dense layers with decreasing neuron count - 1024, 128, 2.
			Decoder was reversed with dense layers of increasing sizes - 128, 1024, 49152(original size).
			Network was trained using original images as target.
		\subsection{Encoder}
			After training, the encoder part of network was used to encode images into 2 values.
			While reduction accounted for large data loss, it allowed for comparison between all of the images relatively quickly by measuring their geometric distance.
